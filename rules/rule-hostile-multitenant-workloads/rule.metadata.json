  "description": "Currently, Kubernetes environments aren't safe for hostile multi-tenant usage. Extra security features, like Pod Security Policies or Kubernetes RBAC for nodes, efficiently block exploits. For true security when running hostile multi-tenant workloads, only trust a hypervisor. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster, not an individual node.",
