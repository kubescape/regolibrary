    "description": "The SecurityContextDeny admission controller can be used to deny pods which make use of some SecurityContext fields which could allow for privilege escalation in the cluster. This should be used where PodSecurityPolicy is not in place within the cluster.",
    "remediation": "Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to include `SecurityContextDeny`, unless `PodSecurityPolicy` is already in place.\n\n \n```\n--enable-admission-plugins=...,SecurityContextDeny,...\n\n```\n\n#### Impact Statement\nThis admission controller should only be used where Pod Security Policies cannot be used on the cluster, as it can interact poorly with certain Pod Security Policies\n\n#### Default Value\nBy default, `SecurityContextDeny` is not set.",
