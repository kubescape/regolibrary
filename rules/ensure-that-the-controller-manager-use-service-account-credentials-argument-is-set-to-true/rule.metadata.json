When using the RBAC authorizer, those roles are created and bound to the appropriate service accounts in the `kube-system` namespace automatically with default roles and rolebindings that are auto-reconciled on startup.\n\n If using other authorization methods (ABAC, Webhook, etc), the cluster deployer is responsible for granting appropriate permissions to the service accounts (the required permissions can be seen by inspecting the `controller-roles.yaml` and `controller-role-bindings.yaml` files for the RBAC roles.\n\n#### Default Value\nBy default, `--use-service-account-credentials` is set to false.",
