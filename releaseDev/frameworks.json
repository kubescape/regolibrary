Image signature verification process is used to verify the integrity of the image and prevent the execution of malicious images. The verification process was pull image manifest twice, once for verification and once for the actual execution. The verification process was bypassed by using a malicious image repository or MITM proxy to return a different manifest for the verification process. This vulnerability was fixed in Kyverno 1.8.5. This issue can be mitigated by using only trusted image repositories and by using a secure connection to the image repository. See C-0001 and C-0078 for limiting the use of trusted repositories.",

Only private subnets are supported for pods running on Fargate; you must deselect any public subnets.\n* For Tags, you can optionally tag your Fargate profile. These tags do not propagate to other resources associated with the profile, such as its pods.\n\n 5. On the Configure pods selection page, enter the following information and choose Next.\n\n * list text hereFor Namespace, enter a namespace to match for pods, such as kube-system or default.\n* Add Kubernetes labels to the selector that pods in the specified namespace must have to match the selector. For example, you could add the label infrastructure: fargate to the selector so that only pods in the specified namespace that also have the infrastructure: fargate Kubernetes label match the selector.\n\n 6. On the Review and create page, review the information for your Fargate profile and choose Create.",
