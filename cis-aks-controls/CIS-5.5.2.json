    "description": "The ability to manage RBAC for Kubernetes resources from Azure gives you the choice to manage RBAC for the cluster resources either using Azure or native Kubernetes mechanisms. When enabled, Azure AD principals will be validated exclusively by Azure RBAC while regular Kubernetes users and service accounts are exclusively validated by Kubernetes RBAC.\n\n Azure role-based access control (RBAC) is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources.\n\n With Azure RBAC, you create a role definition that outlines the permissions to be applied. You then assign a user or group this role definition via a role assignment for a particular scope. The scope can be an individual resource, a resource group, or across the subscription.",
    "long_description": "Today you can already leverage integrated authentication between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and AKS. When enabled, this integration allows customers to use Azure AD users, groups, or service principals as subjects in Kubernetes RBAC. This feature frees you from having to separately manage user identities and credentials for Kubernetes. However, you still have to set up and manage Azure RBAC and Kubernetes RBAC separately. Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization is an approach that allows for the unified management and access control across Azure Resources, AKS, and Kubernetes resources.",
