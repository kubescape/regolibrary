    "description": "An admission controller is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object, but after the request is authenticated and authorized.\n\n Admission controllers limit requests to create, delete, modify or connect to (proxy). They do not support read requests.\n\n The admission control process proceeds in two phases. In the first phase, mutating admission controllers are run. In the second phase, validating admission controllers are run. Note again that some of the controllers are both.\n\n If any of the controllers in either phase reject the request, the entire request is rejected immediately and an error is returned to the end-user.",
    "long_description": "If there are problems in the admission control pipeline, it can block a large number of requests to the API server.",
