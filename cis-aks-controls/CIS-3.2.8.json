    "long_description": "Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver. Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics. Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs. Usage of --hostname-override also may have some undefined/unsupported behaviours.",
    "remediation": "**Remediation Method 1:**\n\n If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf` on each worker node and remove the below parameter from the `KUBELET_ARGS` variable string.\n\n \n```\n--hostname-override\n\n```\n Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service and check status. The example below is for systemctl:\n\n \n```\nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl restart kubelet.service\nsystemctl status kubelet -l\n\n```",
    "manual_test": "**Audit Method 1:**\n\n SSH to each node:\n\n Run the following command on each node to find the Kubelet process:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep kubelet\n\n```\n Verify that `--hostname-override` argument does not exist in the output of the above command.\n\n **Note** This setting is not configurable via the Kubelet config file.",
