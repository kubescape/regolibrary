    "remediation": "Follow the etcd service documentation and configure peer TLS encryption as appropriate for your etcd cluster.\n\n Then, edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameters.\n\n \n```\n--peer-client-file=</path/to/peer-cert-file>\n--peer-key-file=</path/to/peer-key-file>\n\n```",
    "manual_test": "Run the following command on the etcd server node:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep etcd\n\n```\n Verify that the `--peer-cert-file` and `--peer-key-file` arguments are set as appropriate.\n\n **Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable.",
