    "description": "Do not generally admit containers which make use of `hostPath` volumes.",
    "long_description": "A container which mounts a `hostPath` volume as part of its specification will have access to the filesystem of the underlying cluster node. The use of `hostPath` volumes may allow containers access to privileged areas of the node filesystem.\n\n There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to mount `hostPath` volumes.\n\n If you need to run containers which require `hostPath` volumes, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.",
    "remediation": "Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers which use `hostPath` volumes.",
    "manual_test": "List the policies in use for each namespace in the cluster, ensure that each policy disallows the admission of containers with `hostPath` volumes.",
