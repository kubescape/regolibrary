    "description": "Do not generally permit Windows containers to be run with the `hostProcess` flag set to true.",
    "long_description": "A Windows container making use of the `hostProcess` flag can interact with the underlying Windows cluster node. As per the Kubernetes documentation, this provides \"privileged access\" to the Windows node.\n\n Where Windows containers are used inside a Kubernetes cluster, there should be at least one admission control policy which does not permit `hostProcess` Windows containers.\n\n If you need to run Windows containers which require `hostProcess`, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.",
    "remediation": "Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of `hostProcess` containers.",
    "manual_test": "List the policies in use for each namespace in the cluster, ensure that each policy disallows the admission of `hostProcess` containers",
