    "description": "Amazon EKS uses IAM to provide authentication to your Kubernetes cluster through the AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes. You can configure the stock kubectl client to work with Amazon EKS by installing the AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes and modifying your kubectl configuration file to use it for authentication.",
    "long_description": "On- and off-boarding users is often difficult to automate and prone to error. Using a single source of truth for user permissions reduces the number of locations that an individual must be off-boarded from, and prevents users gaining unique permissions sets that increase the cost of audit.",
    "remediation": "Refer to the '[Managing users or IAM roles for your cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html)' in Amazon EKS documentation.\n\n Note: If using AWS CLI version 1.16.156 or later there is no need to install the AWS IAM Authenticator anymore.\n\n The relevant AWS CLI commands, depending on the use case, are:\n\n \n```\naws eks update-kubeconfig\naws eks get-token\n\n```",
    "manual_test": "To Audit access to the namespace $NAMESPACE, assume the IAM role yourIAMRoleName for a user that you created, and then run the following command:\n\n \n```\n$ kubectl get role -n $NAMESPACE\n\n```\n The response lists the RBAC role that has access to this Namespace.",
