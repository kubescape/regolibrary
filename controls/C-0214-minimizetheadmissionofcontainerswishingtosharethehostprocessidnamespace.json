    "long_description": "A container running in the host's PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container.\n\n There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace.\n\n If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.",
