    "remediation": "If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authentication: anonymous: enabled` to `false`.\n\n If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.\n\n \n```\n--anonymous-auth=false\n\n```\n Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:\n\n \n```\nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl restart kubelet.service\n\n```",
    "manual_test": "If using a Kubelet configuration file, check that there is an entry for `authentication: anonymous: enabled` set to `false`.\n\n Run the following command on each node:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep kubelet\n\n```\n Verify that the `--anonymous-auth` argument is set to `false`.\n\n This executable argument may be omitted, provided there is a corresponding entry set to `false` in the Kubelet config file.",
