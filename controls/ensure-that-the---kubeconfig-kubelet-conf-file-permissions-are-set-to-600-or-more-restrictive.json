    "long_description": "The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node.

For example,\n\n \n```\nstat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf\n\n```\n Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.",
