    "long_description": "Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user, whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of container breakout.\n\n Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user.\n\n There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit root containers.\n\n If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.",
    "remediation": "Create a policy for each namespace in the cluster, ensuring that either `MustRunAsNonRoot` or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0, is set.\n\n#### Impact Statement\nPods with containers which run as the root user will not be permitted.\n\n#### Default Value\nBy default, there are no restrictions on the use of root containers and if a User is not specified in the image, the container will run as root.",
    "manual_test": "List the policies in use for each namespace in the cluster, ensure that each policy restricts the use of root containers by setting `MustRunAsNonRoot` or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0.",
