    "long_description": "Using `EventRateLimit` admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice. A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable. This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall. Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept.\n\n Note: This is an Alpha feature in the Kubernetes 1.15 release.",
    "remediation": "Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file.\n\n Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` and set the below parameters.\n\n \n```\n--enable-admission-plugins=...,EventRateLimit,...\n--admission-control-config-file=<path/to/configuration/file>\n\n```",
    "manual_test": "Run the following command on the Control Plane node:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep kube-apiserver\n\n```\n Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `EventRateLimit`.",
