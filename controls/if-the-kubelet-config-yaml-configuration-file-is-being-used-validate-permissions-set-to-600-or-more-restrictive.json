    "long_description": "The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.",

For example,\n\n \n```\nstat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml\n\n```\n Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.",
