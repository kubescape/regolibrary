    "manual_test": "Pod Security Admission is enabled by default on all clusters using Kubernetes 1.23 or higher. To assess what controls, if any, are in place using this mechanism, review the namespaces in the cluster to see if the[required labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/#pod-security-admission-labels-for-namespaces) have been applied\n\n \n```\nkubectl get namespaces -o yaml\n\n```\n To confirm if any external policy control system is in use, review the cluster for the presence of `validatingadmissionwebhook` and `mutatingadmissionwebhook` objects.\n\n \n```\nkubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations\n\n```\n \n```\nkubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations\n\n```",
