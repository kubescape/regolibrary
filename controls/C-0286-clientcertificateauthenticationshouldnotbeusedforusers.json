    "description": "Kubernetes provides the option to use client certificates for user authentication. However as there is no way to revoke these certificates when a user leaves an organization or loses their credential, they are not suitable for this purpose.\n\n It is not possible to fully disable client certificate use within a cluster as it is used for component to component authentication.",
    "long_description": "With any authentication mechanism the ability to revoke credentials if they are compromised or no longer required, is a key control. Kubernetes client certificate authentication does not allow for this due to a lack of support for certificate revocation.",
    "remediation": "Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be implemented in place of client certificates.",
    "manual_test": "Review user access to the cluster and ensure that users are not making use of Kubernetes client certificate authentication.",
