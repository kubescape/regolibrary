    "long_description": "Containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12 where containers launched through containerd\u2019s CRI implementation on Linux with a specially-crafted image configuration could gain access to read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host. This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. This bug was fixed in containerd versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.",
