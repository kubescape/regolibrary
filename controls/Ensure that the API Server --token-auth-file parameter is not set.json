    "description": "Do not use token based authentication.",
    "long_description": "The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver. Hence, do not use static token-based authentication.",
    "remediation": "Follow the documentation and configure alternate mechanisms for authentication. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and remove the `--token-auth-file=<filename>` parameter.\n\n#### Impact Statement\nYou will have to configure and use alternate authentication mechanisms such as certificates. Static token based authentication could not be used.\n\n#### Default Value\nBy default, `--token-auth-file` argument is not set.",
    "manual_test": "Run the following command on the Control Plane node:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep kube-apiserver\n\n```\n Verify that the `--token-auth-file` argument does not exist.",
