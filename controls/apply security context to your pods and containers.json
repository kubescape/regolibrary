    "long_description": "A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context.",
    "remediation": "Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker Containers.",
    "test": "Check that pod and container security context fields according to recommendations in CIS Security Benchmark for Docker Containers",
    "manual_test": "Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that you have security contexts defined as appropriate.",
