Capabilities outside this set can be added to containers which could expose them to risks of container breakout attacks.\n\n There should be at least one policy defined which prevents containers with capabilities beyond the default set from launching.\n\n If you need to run containers with additional capabilities, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.",
