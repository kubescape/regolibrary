Care should be taken to only log Metadata for requests to Secrets, ConfigMaps, and TokenReviews, in order to avoid the risk of logging sensitive data.\n* Modification of `pod` and `deployment` objects.\n* Use of `pods/exec`, `pods/portforward`, `pods/proxy` and `services/proxy`.\n\n For most requests, minimally logging at the Metadata level is recommended (the most basic level of logging).",
