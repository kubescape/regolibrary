In order to be able to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to run code on in the container and the container must have CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges. Linux kernel and all major distro maintainers have released patches. This control alerts on vulnerable kernel versions of Kubernetes nodes.",
