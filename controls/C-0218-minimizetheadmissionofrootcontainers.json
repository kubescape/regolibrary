    "long_description": "Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user, whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of container breakout.\n\n Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user.\n\n There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit root users in a container.\n\n If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.",
