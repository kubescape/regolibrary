    "long_description": "Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver. Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics. Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs.",
    "remediation": "Edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and remove the `--hostname-override` argument from the `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.\n\n Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:\n\n \n```\nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl restart kubelet.service\n\n```\n\n",
    "manual_test": "Run the following command on each node:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep kubelet\n\n```\n Verify that `--hostname-override` argument does not exist.\n\n **Note** This setting is not configurable via the Kubelet config file.",
