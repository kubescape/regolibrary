  "long_description": "The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests.",
  "remediation": "If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client CA file. If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable. ```--client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>``` Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example: ```systemctl daemon-reloadsystemctl restart kubelet.service```",
  "manual_test": "Run the following command on each node: ```ps -ef | grep kubelet``` Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and is set to the location of the client certificate authority file. If the `--client-ca-file` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that the file sets `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client certificate authority file.",
