    "description": "A container-optimized OS is an operating system image that is designed for secure managed hosting of containers on compute instances.\n\n Use cases for container-optimized OSes might include:\n\n * Docker container or Kubernetes support with minimal setup.\n* A small-secure container footprint.\n* An OS that is tested, hardened and verified for running Kubernetes nodes in your compute instances.",
    "long_description": "Container-optimized OSes have a smaller footprint which will reduce the instance's potential attack surface. The container runtime is pre-installed and security settings like locked-down firewall is configured by default. Container-optimized images may also be configured to automatically update on a regular period in the background.",
    "remediation": "",
    "manual_test": "If a container-optimized OS is required examine the nodes in EC2 and click on their AMI to ensure that it is a container-optimized OS like Amazon Bottlerocket; or connect to the worker node and check its OS.",
