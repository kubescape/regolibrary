By default, no network policies are applied to Pods or namespaces, resulting in unrestricted ingress and egress traffic within the Pod network. Pods become isolated through a network policy that applies to the Pod or the Pod\u2019s namespace. Once a Pod is selected in a network policy, it rejects any connections that are not specifically allowed by any applicable policy object.Administrators should use a default policy selecting all Pods to deny all ingress and egress traffic and ensure any unselected Pods are isolated. Additional policies could then relax these restrictions for permissible connections.",
