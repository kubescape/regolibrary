    "long_description": "The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet\u2019s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet\u2019s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet\u2019s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks.",
    "remediation": "Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup the TLS connection between the apiserver and kubelets. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--kubelet-certificate-authority` parameter to the path to the cert file for the certificate authority.\n\n \n```\n--kubelet-certificate-authority=<ca-string>\n\n```",
    "manual_test": "Run the following command on the Control Plane node:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep kube-apiserver\n\n```\n Verify that the `--kubelet-certificate-authority` argument exists and is set as appropriate.",
