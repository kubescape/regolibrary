  "long_description": "Using the `NodeRestriction` plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the `Node` and `Pod` objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own `Node` API object, and only modify `Pod` API objects that are bound to their node.",
  "remediation": "Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure `NodeRestriction` plug-in on kubelets. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`. ```--enable-admission-plugins=...,NodeRestriction,...```",
  "manual_test": "Run the following command on the Control Plane node: ```ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver``` Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`.",
