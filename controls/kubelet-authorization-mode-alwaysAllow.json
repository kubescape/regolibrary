    "remediation": "If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authorization: mode` to `Webhook`.\n\n If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.\n\n \n```\n--authorization-mode=Webhook\n\n```\n Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:\n\n \n```\nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl restart kubelet.service\n\n```\n\n",
    "manual_test": "Run the following command on each node:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep kubelet\n\n```\n If the `--authorization-mode` argument is present check that it is not set to `AlwaysAllow`. If it is not present check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that file sets `authorization: mode` to something other than `AlwaysAllow`.\n\n It is also possible to review the running configuration of a Kubelet via the `/configz` endpoint on the Kubelet API port (typically `10250/TCP`). Accessing these with appropriate credentials will provide details of the Kubelet's configuration.",
