  "long_description": "Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones) without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests.",
  "remediation": "If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authorization: mode` to `Webhook`. If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable. ```--authorization-mode=Webhook``` Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example: ```systemctl daemon-reloadsystemctl restart kubelet.service```",
  "manual_test": "Run the following command on each node: ```ps -ef | grep kubelet``` If the `--authorization-mode` argument is present check that it is not set to `AlwaysAllow`. If it is not present check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that file sets `authorization: mode` to something other than `AlwaysAllow`. It is also possible to review the running configuration of a Kubelet via the `/configz` endpoint on the Kubelet API port (typically `10250/TCP`). Accessing these with appropriate credentials will provide details of the Kubelet's configuration.",
