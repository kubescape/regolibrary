    "description": "Kubernetes provides bootstrap tokens which are intended for use by new nodes joining the cluster\n\n These tokens are not designed for use by end-users they are specifically designed for the purpose of bootstrapping new nodes and not for general authentication",
    "long_description": "Bootstrap tokens are not intended for use as a general authentication mechanism and impose constraints on user and group naming that do not facilitate good RBAC design. They also cannot be used with MFA resulting in a weak authentication mechanism being available.",
    "remediation": "Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be implemented in place of bootstrap tokens.",
    "manual_test": "Review user access to the cluster and ensure that users are not making use of bootstrap token authentication.",
