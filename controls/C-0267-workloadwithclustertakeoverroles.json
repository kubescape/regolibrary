    "description": "Cluster takeover roles include workload creation or update and secret access. They can easily lead to super privileges in the cluster. If an attacker can exploit this workload then the attacker can take over the cluster using the RBAC privileges this workload is assigned to.",

    "long_description": "In Kubernetes, workloads with overly permissive roles pose a significant security risk. When a workload is granted roles that exceed the necessities of its operation, it creates an attack surface for privilege escalation within the cluster. This is especially critical if the roles include permissions for creating, updating, or accessing sensitive resources or secrets. An attacker exploiting such a workload can leverage these excessive privileges to perform unauthorized actions, potentially leading to a full cluster takeover. Ensuring that each service account associated with a workload is limited to permissions that are strictly necessary for its function is crucial in mitigating the risk of cluster takeovers.",
