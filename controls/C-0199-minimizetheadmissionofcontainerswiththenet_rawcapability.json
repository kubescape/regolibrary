    "long_description": "Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities. With Docker as the container runtime the NET\\_RAW capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers.\n\n Ideally, all containers should drop this capability.\n\n There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers with the NET\\_RAW capability.\n\n If you need to run containers with this capability, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.",
