  "remediation": "To utilize AWS ECR for Image scanning please follow the steps below: To create a repository configured for scan on push (AWS CLI) ```aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE``` To edit the settings of an existing repository (AWS CLI) ```aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE``` Use the following steps to start a manual image scan using the AWS Management Console.2. Open the Amazon ECR console at<https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories>.3. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.4. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.5. On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to scan.6. On the Images page, select the image to scan and then choose Scan.",
