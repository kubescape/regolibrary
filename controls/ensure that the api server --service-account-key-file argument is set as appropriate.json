    "long_description": "By default, if no `--service-account-key-file` is specified to the apiserver, it uses the private key from the TLS serving certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. Hence, the public key should be specified to the apiserver with `--service-account-key-file`.",
    "remediation": "Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--service-account-key-file` parameter to the public key file for service accounts:\n\n \n```\n--service-account-key-file=<filename>\n\n```",
    "manual_test": "Run the following command on the Control Plane node:\n\n \n```\nps -ef | grep kube-apiserver\n\n```\n Verify that the `--service-account-key-file` argument exists and is set as appropriate.",
