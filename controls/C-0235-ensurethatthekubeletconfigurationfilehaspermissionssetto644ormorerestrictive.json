  "description": "Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file has permissions of 644 or more restrictive.",
  "long_description": "The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.",
  "remediation": "Run the following command (using the config file location identified in the Audit step) ```chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json```",
  "manual_test": "First, SSH to the relevant worker node: To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running: ```sudo systemctl status kubelet``` The output should return `Active: active (running) since..` Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate Kubelet config file: ```ps -ef | grep kubelet``` The output of the above command should return something similar to `--config /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` which is the location of the Kubelet config file. Run the following command: ```stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json``` The output of the above command is the Kubelet config file's permissions. Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.",
