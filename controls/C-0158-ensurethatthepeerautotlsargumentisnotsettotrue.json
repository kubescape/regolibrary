These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Hence, do not use self-signed certificates for authentication.",
    "remediation": "Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and either remove the `--peer-auto-tls` parameter or set it to `false`.\n\n \n```\n--peer-auto-tls=false\n\n```",

If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable.",
