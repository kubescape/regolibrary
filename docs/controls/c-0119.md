# C-0119 - Ensure that the API Server --authorization-mode argument includes Node

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The `Node` authorization mode only allows kubelets to read `Secret`, `ConfigMap`, `PersistentVolume`, and `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects associated with their nodes.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Restrict kubelet nodes to reading only objects associated with them.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include `Node`.
 
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes `Node`.

 
```
--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC

```
 
### Default Value
By default, `Node` authorization is not enabled.
