# C-0113 - Ensure that the API Server --anonymous-auth argument is set to false

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the API server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests.

 If you are using RBAC authorization, it is generally considered reasonable to allow anonymous access to the API Server for health checks and discovery purposes, and hence this recommendation is not scored. However, you should consider whether anonymous discovery is an acceptable risk for your purposes.

## What this control tests 
Disable anonymous requests to the API server.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--anonymous-auth` argument is set to `false`.
 
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the below parameter.

 
```
--anonymous-auth=false

```
 
### Impact Statement
Anonymous requests will be rejected.
 
### Default Value
By default, anonymous access is enabled.
