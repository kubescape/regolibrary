# C-0090 - CVE-2022-39328-grafana-auth-bypass

## Framework
* AllControls
 
## Severity
Critical

## Description of the issue
An internal security audit identified a race condition in the Grafana codebase, which allowed an unauthenticated user to query an arbitrary endpoint in Grafana. A race condition in the HTTP context creation could result in an HTTP request being assigned the authentication/authorization middlewares of another call. Under heavy load, it is possible that a call protected by a privileged middleware receives the middleware of a public query instead. As a result, an unauthenticated user can successfully query protected endpoints. The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.8 Critical.
