# C-0170 - If the kubelet config.yaml configuration file is being used validate permissions set to 600 or more restrictive

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

```
 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
 
## Remediation
Run the following command (using the config file location identied in the Audit step)

 
```
chmod 600 /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

```
 
### Default Value
By default, the /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml file as set up by `kubeadm` has permissions of 600.
