## Severity

## Description of the issue
It is not recommended to create pods without parental Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet etc.Manual creation if pods may lead to a configuration drifts and other untracked changes in the system. Such pods won't be automatically rescheduled by Kubernetes in case of a crash or infrastructure failure. This control identifies every pod that does not have corresponding parental object.

## What this control tests 
Test if pods are not associated with Deployment, ReplicaSet etc. If not, fail.
 
## Remediation
Create necessary Deployment object for every pod making any pod a first class citizen in your IaC architecture.
 
## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
