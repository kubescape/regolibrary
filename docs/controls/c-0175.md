# C-0175 - Verify that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Frameworks
* cis-eks-t1.2.0
* cis-aks-t1.2.0
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster.
 
## What this control tests 
Disable the read-only port.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on each node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kubelet

```
 Verify that the `--read-only-port` argument exists and is set to `0`.

 If the `--read-only-port` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`. Check that if there is a `readOnlyPort` entry in the file, it is set to `0`.
 
## Remediation
If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `readOnlyPort` to `0`.

 If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

 
```
--read-only-port=0

```
 Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

 
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

```
 
### Impact Statement
Removal of the read-only port will require that any service which made use of it will need to be re-configured to use the main Kubelet API.
 
### Default Value
By default, `--read-only-port` is set to `10255/TCP`. However, if a config file is specified by `--config` the default value for `readOnlyPort` is 0.
