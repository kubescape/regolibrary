# C-0031 - Delete Kubernetes events

## Frameworks
* MITRE
* AllControls
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
A Kubernetes event is a Kubernetes object that logs state changes and failures of the resources in the cluster. Example events are a container creation, an image pull, or a pod scheduling on a node. Kubernetes events can be very useful for identifying changes that occur in the cluster. Therefore, attackers may want to delete these events (e.g., by using: “kubectl delete events–all”) in an attempt to avoid detection of their activity in the cluster.

## What this control tests 
List who has delete/deletecollection RBAC permissions on events.
 
## Remediation
You should follow the least privilege principle. Minimize the number of subjects who can delete Kubernetes events. Avoid using these subjects in the daily operations.
 
## Example
```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-exec
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["events"]  		   # we look for this resource or *
  verbs: ["delete","deletecollection"]	   # we look for this verb or * 	
```
