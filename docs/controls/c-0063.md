# C-0063 - Portforwarding privileges

## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
Attackers who have relevant RBAC permissions, can run open a backdoor communication channel directly to the sockets inside target container using exec command “kubectl portforward” command. Using this method, attackers can bypass network security restrictions and communicate directly with software in the containers.

## What this control tests 
Check which subjects have RBAC permissions to portforward into pods– if they have the “pods/portforward” resource.
 
## Remediation
It is recommended to prohibit “kubectl portforward” command in production environments. It is also recommended not to use subjects with this permission for daily cluster operations.
 
## Example
```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: allow-port-forward
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["pods", "pods/portforward"] # we look for this resource or *
  verbs: ["update", "patch", "create"]	  # we look for these verbs or *
```
