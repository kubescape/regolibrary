# C-0169 - Ensure that the client certificate authorities file ownership is set to root:root

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the certificate authorities file ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kubelet

```
 Find the file specified by the `--client-ca-file` argument.

 Run the following command:

 
```
stat -c %U:%G <filename>

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## Remediation
Run the following command to modify the ownership of the `--client-ca-file`.

 
```
chown root:root <filename>

```
 
### Default Value
By default no `--client-ca-file` is specified.
