# C-0122 - Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Setting admission control plugin `AlwaysAdmit` allows all requests and do not filter any requests.

 The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers.

## What this control tests 
Do not allow all requests.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that if the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set, its value does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.
 
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and either remove the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter, or set it to a value that does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.
 
### Impact Statement
Only requests explicitly allowed by the admissions control plugins would be served.
 
### Default Value
`AlwaysAdmit` is not in the list of default admission plugins.
