# C-0250 - Minimize cluster access to read-only for Azure Container Registry (ACR)

## Prerequisites
 *Integrate with cloud provider (see [here](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/kubescape-integration-with-cloud-providers))*
 
## Framework
* cis-aks-t1.2.0
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The Cluster Service Account does not require administrative access to Azure ACR, only requiring pull access to containers to deploy onto Azure AKS. Restricting permissions follows the principles of least privilege and prevents credentials from being abused beyond the required role.
 
## What this control tests 
Configure the Cluster Service Account with Storage Object Viewer Role to only allow read-only access to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
 
### Impact Statement
A separate dedicated service account may be required for use by build servers and other robot users pushing or managing container images.
