# C-0187 - Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles

## Frameworks
* cis-eks-t1.2.0
* cis-aks-t1.2.0
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
* ClusterScan
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
The principle of least privilege recommends that users are provided only the access required for their role and nothing more. The use of wildcard rights grants is likely to provide excessive rights to the Kubernetes API.

## What this control tests 
Check which subjects have wildcard RBAC permissions.
 
## How to check it manually 
Retrieve the roles defined across each namespaces in the cluster and review for wildcards

 
```
kubectl get roles --all-namespaces -o yaml

```
 Retrieve the cluster roles defined in the cluster and review for wildcards

 
```
kubectl get clusterroles -o yaml

```
 
## Remediation
Where possible replace any use of wildcards in clusterroles and roles with specific objects or actions.
