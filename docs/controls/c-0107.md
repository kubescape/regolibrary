## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity

## Description of the issue
The `scheduler.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the `scheduler.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf

```
 
### Default Value
By default, `scheduler.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
