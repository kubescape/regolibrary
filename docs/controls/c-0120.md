# C-0120 - Ensure that the API Server --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Turn on Role Based Access Control.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include `RBAC`.
 
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes `RBAC`, for example:

 
```
--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC

```
 
### Impact Statement
When RBAC is enabled you will need to ensure that appropriate RBAC settings (including Roles, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings) are configured to allow appropriate access.
 
### Default Value
By default, `RBAC` authorization is not enabled.
