# C-0014 - Access Kubernetes dashboard

## Frameworks
* MITRE
* AllControls
 
## Severity
Low

## Description of the issue
The Kubernetes dashboard is a web-based UI that is used for monitoring and managing the Kubernetes cluster. The dashboard allows users to perform actions in the cluster using its service account (Kubernetes-dashboard) with the permissions that are determined by the binding or cluster-binding for this service account. Attackers who gain access to a container in the cluster, can use its network access to the dashboard pod. Consequently, attackers may retrieve information about the various resources in the cluster using the dashboard’s identity.

## What this control tests 
Check who is associated with the dashboard service account or bound to dashboard role/clusterrole.
 
## Remediation
Make sure that the “Kubernetes Dashboard” service account is only bound to the Kubernetes dashboard following the least privilege principle.
