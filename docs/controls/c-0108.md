## Framework

## Description of the issue
The `controller-manager.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Controller Manager. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the `controller-manager.conf` file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf

```
 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf

```
 
### Default Value
By default, `controller-manager.conf` has permissions of `640`.
