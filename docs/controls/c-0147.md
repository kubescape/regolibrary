# C-0147 - Ensure that the Controller Manager --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with `--service-account-private-key-file` as appropriate.

## What this control tests 
Explicitly set a service account private key file for service accounts on the controller manager.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager

```
 Verify that the `--service-account-private-key-file` argument is set as appropriate.
 
## Remediation
Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--service-account-private-key-file` parameter to the private key file for service accounts.

 
```
--service-account-private-key-file=<filename>

```
 
### Impact Statement
You would need to securely maintain the key file and rotate the keys based on your organization's key rotation policy.
 
### Default Value
By default, `--service-account-private-key-file` it not set.
