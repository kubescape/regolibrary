# C-0153 - Ensure that the --cert-file and --key-file arguments are set as appropriate

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Configure TLS encryption for the etcd service.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the etcd server node

 
```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```
 Verify that the `--cert-file` and the `--key-file` arguments are set as appropriate.
 
## Remediation
Follow the etcd service documentation and configure TLS encryption.

 Then, edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameters.

 
```
--cert-file=</path/to/ca-file>
--key-file=</path/to/key-file>

```
 
### Impact Statement
Client connections only over TLS would be served.
 
### Default Value
By default, TLS encryption is not set.
