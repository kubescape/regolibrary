# C-0213 - Minimize the admission of privileged containers

## Frameworks
* cis-eks-t1.2.0
* cis-aks-t1.2.0
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel capabilities and devices. A container running with full privileges can do almost everything that the host can do. This flag exists to allow special use-cases, like manipulating the network stack and accessing devices.

 There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit privileged containers.

 If you need to run privileged containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.

PodSecurityPolicy
 
## What this control tests 
Do not generally permit containers to be run with the `securityContext.privileged` flag set to `true`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Get the set of PSPs with the following command:

 
```
kubectl get psp

```
 For each PSP, check whether privileged is enabled:

 
```
kubectl get psp -o json

```
 Verify that there is at least one PSP which does not return `true`.

 `kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.privileged}'`
 
## Remediation
Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the `.spec.privileged` field is set to `false`.
 
### Impact Statement
Pods defined with `spec.containers[].securityContext.privileged: true` will not be permitted.
 
### Default Value
By default, when you provision an EKS cluster, a pod security policy called `eks.privileged` is automatically created. The manifest for that policy appears below:

 
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/description: privileged allows full unrestricted access to pod features,
      as if the PodSecurityPolicy controller was not enabled.
