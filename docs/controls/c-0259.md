## Remediation
Use Kubernetes secrets or Key Management Systems to store credentials.
 
## Configuration parameters 
 You can adjust the configuration of this control to suit your specific environment. [Read the documentation on configuring controls](../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls.md) to learn more.
 
* [sensitiveValues](../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls.md#sensitivevalues):
Strings that identify a value that Kubescape believes should be stored in a Secret, and not in a ConfigMap or an environment variable.
 
* [sensitiveKeyNames](../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls.md#sensitivekeynames):
Key names that identify a potential value that should be stored in a Secret, and not in a ConfigMap or an environment variable.
 
* [sensitiveValuesAllowed](../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls.md#sensitivevaluesallowed):
Explicitly allowed values, which will override sensitiveValues.
