# C-0157 - Ensure that the --peer-client-cert-auth argument is set to true

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
etcd should be configured for peer authentication.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the etcd server node: ```ps -ef | grep etcd``` Verify that the `--peer-client-cert-auth` argument is set to `true`. **Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable.
 
## Remediation
Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameter. ```--peer-client-cert-auth=true```
 
### Impact Statement
All peers attempting to communicate with the etcd server will require a valid client certificate for authentication.
 
### Default Value
**Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable. By default, `--peer-client-cert-auth` argument is set to `false`.
