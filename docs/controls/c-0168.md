# C-0168 - Ensure that the certificate authorities file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the certificate authorities file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kubelet

```
 Find the file specified by the `--client-ca-file` argument.

 Run the following command:

 
```
stat -c %a <filename>

```
 Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
 
## Remediation
Run the following command to modify the file permissions of the `--client-ca-file`

 
```
chmod 600 <filename>

```
 
### Default Value
By default no `--client-ca-file` is specified.
