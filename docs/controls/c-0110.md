# C-0110 - Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by `root:root`.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/

```
 Verify that the ownership of all files and directories in this hierarchy is set to `root:root`.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chown -R root:root /etc/kubernetes/pki/

```
 
### Default Value
By default, the /etc/kubernetes/pki/ directory and all of the files and directories contained within it, are set to be owned by the root user.
