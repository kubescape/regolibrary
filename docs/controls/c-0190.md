# C-0190 - Ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary

## Frameworks
* cis-eks-t1.2.0
* cis-aks-t1.2.0
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster.

 Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue.

## What this control tests 
Check that all service accounts and workloads disable automount of service account tokens.
 
## How to check it manually 
Review pod and service account objects in the cluster and ensure that the option below is set, unless the resource explicitly requires this access.

 
```
automountServiceAccountToken: false

```
 
## Remediation
Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it.
 
### Impact Statement
Pods mounted without service account tokens will not be able to communicate with the API server, except where the resource is available to unauthenticated principals.
 
### Default Value
By default, all pods get a service account token mounted in them.
