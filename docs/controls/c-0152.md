# C-0152 - Ensure that the Scheduler --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Do not bind the scheduler service to non-loopback insecure addresses.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler

```
 Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1
 
## Remediation
Edit the Scheduler pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter
 
### Default Value
By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0
