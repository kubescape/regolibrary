# C-0116 - Ensure that the API Server --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments are set as appropriate

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously. You should set up certificate-based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Enable certificate based kubelet authentication.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--kubelet-client-certificate` and `--kubelet-client-key` arguments exist and they are set as appropriate.
 
## Remediation
Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between the apiserver and kubelets. Then, edit API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the kubelet client certificate and key parameters as below.

 
```
--kubelet-client-certificate=<path/to/client-certificate-file>
--kubelet-client-key=<path/to/client-key-file>

```
 
### Impact Statement
You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
 
### Default Value
By default, certificate-based kubelet authentication is not set.
