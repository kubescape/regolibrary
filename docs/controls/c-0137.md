# C-0137 - Ensure that the API Server --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments are set as appropriate

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a client certificate and key.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
etcd should be configured to make use of TLS encryption for client connections.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--etcd-certfile` and `--etcd-keyfile` arguments exist and they are set as appropriate.
 
## Remediation
Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between the apiserver and etcd. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the etcd certificate and key file parameters.

 
```
--etcd-certfile=<path/to/client-certificate-file> 
--etcd-keyfile=<path/to/client-key-file>

```
 
### Impact Statement
TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for etcd.
 
### Default Value
By default, `--etcd-certfile` and `--etcd-keyfile` arguments are not set
