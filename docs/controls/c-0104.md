# C-0104 - Ensure that the admin.conf file permissions are set to 600

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
The `admin.conf` is the administrator kubeconfig file defining various settings for the administration of the cluster. This file contains private key and respective certificate allowed to fully manage the cluster. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the file. The file should be readable and writable by only the administrators on the system.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the `admin.conf` file has permissions of `600`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

```
 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

```
 
### Impact Statement
None.
 
### Default Value
By default, admin.conf has permissions of `600`.
