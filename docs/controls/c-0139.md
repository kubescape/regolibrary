# C-0139 - Ensure that the API Server --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. If `--client-ca-file` argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the `client-ca-file` is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Setup TLS connection on the API server.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and it is set as appropriate.
 
## Remediation
Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection on the apiserver. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the client certificate authority file.

 
```
--client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>

```
 
### Impact Statement
TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for your Kubernetes cluster deployment.
 
### Default Value
By default, `--client-ca-file` argument is not set.
