# C-0148 - Ensure that the Controller Manager --root-ca-file argument is set as appropriate

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Processes running within pods that need to contact the API server must verify the API server's serving certificate. Failing to do so could be a subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.

 Providing the root certificate for the API server's serving certificate to the controller manager with the `--root-ca-file` argument allows the controller manager to inject the trusted bundle into pods so that they can verify TLS connections to the API server.

## What this control tests 
Allow pods to verify the API server's serving certificate before establishing connections.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager

```
 Verify that the `--root-ca-file` argument exists and is set to a certificate bundle file containing the root certificate for the API server's serving certificate.
 
## Remediation
Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--root-ca-file` parameter to the certificate bundle file`.

 
```
--root-ca-file=<path/to/file>

```
 
### Impact Statement
You need to setup and maintain root certificate authority file.
 
### Default Value
By default, `--root-ca-file` is not set.
