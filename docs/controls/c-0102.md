# C-0102 - Ensure that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should not be readable or writable by any group members or the world.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the etcd data directory has permissions of `700` or more restrictive.
 
## How to check it manually 
On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```
 Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above). For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /var/lib/etcd

```
 Verify that the permissions are `700` or more restrictive.
 
## Remediation
On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```
 Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above). For example,

 
```
chmod 700 /var/lib/etcd

```
 
### Default Value
By default, etcd data directory has permissions of `755`.
