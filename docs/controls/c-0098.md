# C-0098 - Ensure that the etcd pod specification file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. etcd is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

```
 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

```
 
### Default Value
By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of `640`.
