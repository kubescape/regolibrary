# C-0127 - Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
Using the `NodeRestriction` plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the `Node` and `Pod` objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own `Node` API object, and only modify `Pod` API objects that are bound to their node.

Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Limit the `Node` and `Pod` objects that a kubelet could modify.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`.
 
## Remediation
Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure `NodeRestriction` plug-in on kubelets. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`.

 
```
--enable-admission-plugins=...,NodeRestriction,...

```
 
### Default Value
By default, `NodeRestriction` is not set.
