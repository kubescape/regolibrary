# C-0207 - Prefer using secrets as files over secrets as environment variables

## Frameworks
* cis-eks-t1.2.0
* cis-aks-t1.2.0
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
* WorkloadScan
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
It is reasonably common for application code to log out its environment (particularly in the event of an error). This will include any secret values passed in as environment variables, so secrets can easily be exposed to any user or entity who has access to the logs.
 
## Related resources

## What this control tests 
Check if pods have secrets in their environment variables
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command to find references to objects which use environment variables defined from secrets.

 
```
kubectl get all -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@..secretKeyRef)]} {.kind} {.metadata.name} {"\n"}{end}' -A

```
 
## Remediation
If possible, rewrite application code to read secrets from mounted secret files, rather than from environment variables.
 
### Impact Statement
Application code which expects to read secrets in the form of environment variables would need modification
 
### Default Value
By default, secrets are not defined
