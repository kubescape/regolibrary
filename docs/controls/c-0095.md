# C-0095 - Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file ownership is set to root:root

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The controller manager pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of various components of the master node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml

```
 
### Default Value
By default, `kube-controller-manager.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
