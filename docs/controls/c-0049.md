# C-0049 - Network mapping

## Frameworks

* ArmoBest
 
## Severity
Low

## Description of the issue
Attackers may try to map the cluster network to get information on the running applications, including scanning for known vulnerabilities. By default, there is no restriction on pods communication in Kubernetes. Therefore, attackers who gain access to a single container, may use it to probe the network.
 
## Related resources
Namespace, NetworkPolicy
 
## What this control tests 
Check for each namespace if there is a network policy defined.
 
## Remediation
Define network policies or use similar network protection mechanisms.
 
## Example
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
  namespace: default		# we make sure "NetworkPolicy" exists on this namespace
```
