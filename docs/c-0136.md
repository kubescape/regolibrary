## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the the issue
By default, if no `--service-account-key-file` is specified to the apiserver, it uses the private key from the TLS serving certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. Hence, the public key should be specified to the apiserver with `--service-account-key-file`.
 
## Related resources

## What does this control test
Explicitly set a service account public key file for service accounts on the apiserver.
 
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--service-account-key-file` argument exists and is set as appropriate.
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--service-account-key-file` parameter to the public key file for service accounts:

 
```
--service-account-key-file=<filename>

```
 
### Impact Statement
The corresponding private key must be provided to the controller manager. You would need to securely maintain the key file and rotate the keys based on your organization's key rotation policy.
### Default Value
By default, `--service-account-key-file` argument is not set.
## Example
No example
