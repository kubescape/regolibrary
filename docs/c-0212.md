## Framework
cis-eks-t1.2.0, cis-aks-t1.2.0, cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the the issue
Resources in a Kubernetes cluster should be segregated by namespace, to allow for security controls to be applied at that level and to make it easier to manage resources.
 
## Related resources

## What does this control test
Lists all resources in default namespace for user to review and approve.
 
## How to check it manually
Run this command to list objects in default namespace

 
```
kubectl get $(kubectl api-resources --verbs=list --namespaced=true -o name | paste -sd, -) --ignore-not-found -n default

```
 The only entries there should be system managed resources such as the `kubernetes` service
## Remediation
Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.
 
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
Unless a namespace is specific on object creation, the `default` namespace will be used
## Example
No example
