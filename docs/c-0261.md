## Description of the the issue
Potential attacker may gain access to a workload and steal its ServiceAccount token. Therefore, it is recommended to disable automatic mapping of the ServiceAccount tokens in ServiceAccount configuration. Enable it only for workloads that need to use them and ensure that this ServiceAccount is not bound to an unnecessary ClusterRoleBinding or RoleBinding.
