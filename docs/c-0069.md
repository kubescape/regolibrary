## What does this control test
Reading the kubelet command lines and configuration file looking for anonymous-auth configuration. If this configuration is set on both, the command line values take precedence over it.
 
## Remediation
Start the kubelet with the --anonymous-auth=false flag.
 
## Example
No example
